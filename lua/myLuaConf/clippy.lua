-- so, my normal mode <leader>y randomly didnt accept any motions.
-- I didnt know it was meant to, because that was my first install of neovim.
-- If that ever happens to you, comment out the normal one, then uncomment this keymap and the function below it.
-- A full purge of all previous config files installed via pacman fixed it for me, as the pacman config was the one that had that problem.
-- I thought I was cool, but apparently I was doing a workaround to restore default behavior.

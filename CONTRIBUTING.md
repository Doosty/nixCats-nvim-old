Post to discussions about any debuggers or other things with build steps not on nixpkgs,

so that others may easily import that debugger/lsp/dependency/whatever they've been wanting as well!

The main drawback to using nix for nvim is when the thing is not on nixpkgs and has a hard build step.

So, again, when you figure a derivation out, regardless of what nvim related thing it is, post it to discussions!!!

First on the list is a way for building vscode debuggers not on nixpkgs.
At least one of these should be merged into the main repo for use as a reasonable template.

Second is 1 formatter/linter setup for 1 language, preferrably nix and/or lua

Third is add motions to the which-key.nvim popup for \<leader\>y. Maybe. Doesn't matter much.

After that this repo will simply be recieving maintenance and be kept up to date.

Outside of that, clone or fork the repo and do as you please, 
but adding plugins and bells and whistles to main gets in the way of the kickstarter spirit.
